		<h4>Got some eggs on toast</h4>
		<p>Eggs on toast is a classic and versatile meal that can be enjoyed at any time of the day. To prepare this dish, start by toasting slices of bread to your desired level of crispiness. Meanwhile, heat a pan and 
  crack open some fresh eggs, cooking them to your preferred level of doneness - whether that's sunny-side up, over easy, or scrambled. Once the eggs are ready, gently place them on top of the toast, seasoning  
  with salt, pepper, and any additional toppings you desire, such as avocado slices, cherry tomatoes, or a sprinkle of parsley. The combination of warm, runny yolk mixing with the crunchy toast creates a        
  comforting and delicious experience that is sure to satisfy your hunger and taste buds.</p><br>
